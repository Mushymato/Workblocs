Workblocs is a Google Chrome extension.
It replaces chrome://newtab with a simple note taking tool.
Users can have many notes on the screen, each with a title and body.
Notes are stored and synced across the user's google account such that the notes are retained when the user logs into chrome on another device.
They can be downloaded as plain text files at anytime by hotkey ctrl+s
